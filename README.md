<h1>Deploying-Active-Directory-Part-1</h1>
This tutorial guides you through setting up a Domain Controller (DC) using Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) in a Windows Server environment. It covers creating organizational units (OUs), establishing a domain admin user, and joining a client machine (Client-1) to the domain. Finally, the tutorial helps you organize and manage domain users and computers within Active Directory for better administration. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [Deploying-Active-Directory-Part-1](https://youtu.be/kdiHus6eiRc?si=aAm-g_4NeCuBEfsZ)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

-Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Computer)

-Remote Desktop

-Active Directory Domain Services

-Active Directory Users and Computers


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

-Windows Server 2022

-Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Log into DC-1, install Active Directory Domain Services, and promote it as a Domain Controller with a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com). After a restart, log back in as mydomain.com\labuser.
- In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create OUs _EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS. Create a user jane_admin with password Cyberlab123!, add them to the Domain Admins group, and then log out. Log back in as mydomain.com\jane_admin and use this account as the admin moving forward.
- Set Client-1's DNS to DC-1â€™s private IP (already done), restart Client-1, and log in as the local admin (labuser). Join Client-1 to the domain, restart, and verify it shows up in ADUC. Create an OU _CLIENTS and move Client-1 into it.

</p>
<p>
Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

Right-click on the domain name (mydomain.com) and select New > Organizational Unit.

Create an OU named _EMPLOYEES.

Create another OU named _ADMINS.

Right-click on the _ADMINS OU, select New > User.

Name the user Jane Doe with the username jane_admin.

Set the password as Cyberlab123!.

Click Next and finish creating the user.

In ADUC, locate the jane_admin user in the _ADMINS OU.

Right-click on jane_admin, select Add to a group, and add it to the Domain Admins group.

Log out of the DC-1 server and log back in as jane_admin (using the credentials mydomain.com\jane_admin).

<p>
On Client-1, log in as the local admin user (labuser).
Go to Control Panel > System and Security > System and select Change settings under Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings.

Click Change, select Domain, and enter mydomain.com.

When prompted, enter the credentials for a domain admin (e.g., jane_admin).

Restart Client-1 after the domain join process is complete.

On DC-1, open ADUC and verify that Client-1 appears in the domain.

In ADUC, right-click on mydomain.com, select New > Organizational Unit, and create an OU named _CLIENTS.

Drag Client-1 into the _CLIENTS OU.
